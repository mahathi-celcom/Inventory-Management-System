# User Form Horizontal Layout & UX Enhancements

## Summary
Successfully enhanced the User Management form with a more horizontal layout, improved user experience, and fixed visibility issues with the selected user type display.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Fixed Selected Type Visibility Issue** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Selected type badge for "Permanent" was not visible (same color contrast issue as before)
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced low-contrast Celcom opacity classes with high-contrast standard colors
  - Used `ngSwitch` directive instead of method calls for reliable rendering
  - Applied explicit color combinations:
    - Permanent: `bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 border-blue-200`
    - Contractor: `bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 border-orange-200`
    - OfficeAsset: `bg-green-100 text-green-800 border-green-200`

### 2. **Enhanced Horizontal Layout** ‚úÖ
- **User Type Selection**: Changed from vertical to 3-column grid layout (`lg:grid-cols-3`)
- **Form Fields**: Organized into two distinct sections:
  - **Primary Information** (4 columns): Name, Employee Code, Email, Department
  - **Additional Details** (5 columns): Designation, Location, Country, City, Status
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Added numbered section headers with color-coded icons

### 3. **Improved User Experience** ‚úÖ
- **Interactive Radio Buttons**: Added hover effects and visual feedback
- **Card-based Layout**: Separated sections with white cards and shadows
- **Form Validation Indicator**: Added real-time form status display
- **Enhanced Buttons**: Modern styling with icons and improved accessibility
- **Visual Feedback**: Added emojis and status indicators throughout

### 4. **Better Visual Design** ‚úÖ
- **Color Scheme**: Moved from Celcom-specific colors to universally accessible colors
- **Input Styling**: Consistent rounded inputs with proper focus states
- **Section Organization**: Clear visual separation between different form sections
- **Responsive Design**: Proper grid breakpoints for different screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### User Type Selection Structure

```

    <!-- Essential fields -->
  </div>
</div>

  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-5 gap-4">
    <!-- Additional fields -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Fixed User Type Display
