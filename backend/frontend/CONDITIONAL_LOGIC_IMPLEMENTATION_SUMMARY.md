# Asset Status and User Assignment Conditional Logic Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive conditional logic for asset status changes and user assignments with automatic business rule enforcement, real-time validation, and enhanced user experience.

## ✅ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **User Auto-Unassignment for Certain Statuses**
- **Trigger Statuses**: `In Stock`, `Broken`, `Ceased`
- **Behavior**: Automatically unassigns current user when status changes to these values
- **User Experience**: Shows confirmation dialog with clear messaging
- **Toast Notification**: "Status updated to {status}. User unassigned due to asset status."

### 2. **Auto-Activate on Assignment (for 'In Stock')**
- **Trigger**: When a user is assigned to an asset with status `In Stock`
- **Behavior**: Automatically changes status to `Active`
- **User Experience**: Shows confirmation dialog before proceeding
- **Toast Notification**: "User assigned successfully. Status updated to Active as user is assigned."

### 3. **Assignment Allowed for 'In Repair'**
- **Behavior**: Allows user assignment without restrictions
- **No automatic status changes**: Status remains `In Repair`

### 4. **Disallow Assignment for 'Broken' or 'Ceased'**
- **Restricted Statuses**: `Broken`, `Ceased`
- **Behavior**: 
  - Prevents new user assignments
  - Automatically clears existing assignments when status changes
  - Disables assignment dropdown/buttons
- **User Experience**: Shows error message "Assignment not allowed for {status} assets"

### 5. **Real-time Sync**
- **Bidirectional Logic**: Works both ways
  - Status change → User assignment validation
  - User assignment → Status change validation
- **Form Validation**: Real-time form updates with validators

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Methods Added

#### `onAssetStatusChange(asset: Asset, newStatus: string)`
- Main entry point for status changes
- Checks if unassignment is required
- Shows confirmation dialogs
- Routes to appropriate execution method

#### `onAssetUserAssignment(asset: Asset, newUserId: number | null)`
- Main entry point for user assignments
- Validates assignment permissions
- Handles auto-activation logic
- Routes to appropriate execution method

#### `isAssignmentAllowedForStatus(status: string)`
- Validates if user assignment is allowed for given status
- Returns `false` for `Broken` and `Ceased` statuses
- Used throughout the application for UI state management

#### Execution Methods
- `executeStatusChangeWithUnassignment()` - Handles status change + user unassignment
- `executeUserAssignmentWithStatusChange()` - Handles user assignment + status change
- `executeStatusChange()` - Normal status change without user modifications  
- `executeUserAssignment()` - Normal user assignment without status modifications
- `executeUserUnassignment()` - Handles user unassignment

### Form Integration

#### `onAssetFormChange()`
- Monitors form changes in real-time
- Auto-clears user assignments for restricted statuses
- Updates form validators dynamically

#### `updateFormValidators(status: string)`
- Enables/disables user assignment controls based on status
- Prevents form submission for invalid combinations

#### `handleUserAssignmentSubmit()`
- New form submission handler for user assignment modal
- Integrates with conditional logic methods
- Replaces direct API calls with business rule enforcement

## 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements

### Status Dropdown
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses `onAssetStatusChange()` instead of modal-based changes
- **Loading States**: Shows disabled state during processing
- **Visual Feedback**: Maintains existing status badge styling

### User Assignment Button
- **Dynamic Tooltip**: Context-aware tooltip messages
- **State Management**: Disabled for restricted statuses
- **Loading Indicator**: Shows processing state

### User Assignment Modal
- **Status Display**: Shows current asset status with color coding
- **Warning Messages**: 
  - Red warning for restricted statuses
  - Blue info for auto-activation scenarios
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with loading states
- **Dynamic Labels**: Button text changes based on context

### Toast Notifications
- **Success Messages**: Clear feedback for completed operations
- **Error Messages**: Specific error messages for different scenarios
- **Context-Aware**: Messages include relevant details (asset name, status, etc.)

## 📋 Business Rules Matrix

| Current Status | User Assignment | New Status | Action |
|---------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| In Stock | Assign User | Active | ✅ Auto-change to Active |
| In Stock | No Change | In Stock | ✅ No restrictions |
| Active | Unassign User | Active | ✅ Allow unassignment |
| Active | Change to In Stock | In Stock | ✅ Auto-unassign user |
| Active | Change to Broken | Broken | ✅ Auto-unassign user |
| Active | Change to Ceased | Ceased | ✅ Auto-unassign user |
| In Repair | Assign User | In Repair | ✅ Allow assignment |
| In Repair | No Change | In Repair | ✅ No restrictions |
| Broken | Try to Assign | Broken | ❌ Block assignment |
| Ceased | Try to Assign | Ceased | ❌ Block assignment |

## 🔄 API Integration

### Assignment Service Methods Used
- `assignUserToAsset(dto: AssetUserAssignmentDTO)` - For user assignments
- `getCurrentUserAssignment(assetId: number)` - To get assignment ID for unassignment
- `unassignUserFromAsset(assignmentId: number)` - For user unassignments

### Asset Service Methods Used
- `changeAssetStatus(request: AssetStatusChangeRequest)` - For status changes

### Error Handling
- **Comprehensive Try-Catch**: All operations wrapped in error handling
- **Fallback Strategies**: Graceful degradation when APIs fail
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Technical errors translated to user-friendly messages

## 🧪 Testing & Debugging

### Debug Methods Added
- `debugAllFunctionality()` - Tests all conditional logic scenarios
- Enhanced logging with emoji indicators for easy identification
- Comprehensive validation at each step

### Testing Scenarios Covered
1. Status change with user unassignment
2. User assignment with status activation  
3. Assignment prevention for restricted statuses
4. Form validation in real-time
5. Error handling and recovery

## 📝 Configuration

### Status Constants
```typescript
const statusRequiringUnassignment = ['In Stock', 'Broken', 'Ceased'];
const disallowedStatuses = ['Broken', 'Ceased'];
```

### Customizable Messages
- All user-facing messages are configurable
- Toast notifications can be customized
- Error messages are context-aware

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Reactive Updates
- Uses Angular signals for reactive state management
- Minimal re-renders with computed properties
- Efficient change detection

### Loading States
- Individual loading states for different operations
- Non-blocking UI updates
- Progressive enhancement

## 📱 Responsive Design
- Modal dialogs work on all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly buttons and controls
- Accessible form controls with proper ARIA labels

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- All user inputs validated on frontend and backend
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- Role-based access control maintained

## 📊 Success Metrics
