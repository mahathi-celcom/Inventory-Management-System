# Soft Delete Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of soft delete functionality for the Asset entity by adding a `deleted` field.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes (`V004__add_deleted_field_to_asset.sql`)

**Column Addition:**
- **Added:** `deleted` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE

**Migration Process:**
1. Added `deleted` column with default value FALSE
2. Updated existing records to set deleted = FALSE
3. Added NOT NULL constraint
4. Created performance index on deleted field

**Business Logic:**
- `deleted = false`: Asset is active and visible
- `deleted = true`: Asset is soft deleted and hidden from regular queries

### 2. Entity Model Updates (`Asset.java`)

**Field Addition:**
```java
// Soft delete flag
@Column(name = "deleted", nullable = false)
private Boolean deleted = false;
```

**Key Updates:**
- Added deleted field with default value false
- Updated @PrePersist to ensure deleted is set to false for new entities
- Field is non-nullable with database-level constraint

### 3. DTO Updates (`AssetDTO.java`)

**Field Addition:**
```java
// Soft delete flag
private Boolean deleted;
```

**Key Updates:**
- Added deleted field to DTO
- Field is nullable in DTO (optional for API operations)

### 4. Repository Enhancements (`AssetRepository.java`)

**Updated All Query Methods:**
- All existing queries now include `WHERE a.deleted = false` condition
- This ensures only active assets are returned by default

**New Query Methods:**
```java
// Soft delete management
Page<Asset> findAllDeleted(Pageable pageable);
@Modifying @Transactional
void softDeleteByAssetId(Long assetId);
@Modifying @Transactional  
void restoreByAssetId(Long assetId);

// Admin queries
Page<Asset> findAll(Pageable pageable); // Includes deleted assets
```

**Updated Existence Checks:**
- `existsBySerialNumber()` and `existsByItAssetCode()` now only check active assets
- This prevents conflicts with deleted assets having same identifiers

### 5. Service Layer Updates (`AssetService.java` & `AssetServiceImpl.java`)

**New Service Methods:**
```java
// Soft delete management
PageResponse<AssetDTO> getDeletedAssets(Pageable pageable);
PageResponse<AssetDTO> getAllAssetsIncludingDeleted(Pageable pageable);
void restoreAsset(Long assetId);
void permanentlyDeleteAsset(Long assetId); // Hard delete
```

**Updated Existing Methods:**
- `deleteAsset()`: Now performs soft delete instead of hard delete
- `getAsset()`: Throws exception if asset is deleted
- `updateAsset()`: Prevents updating deleted assets

**Enhanced Validation:**
- Checks asset deletion status before operations
- Proper error messages for deleted asset operations
- Audit logging for all delete/restore operations

### 6. Controller Updates (`AssetController.java`)

**New REST Endpoints:**
```java
// Soft delete management endpoints
GET /api/assets/deleted                    // Get deleted assets
GET /api/assets/all-including-deleted      // Get all assets (admin)
POST /api/assets/{assetId}/restore         // Restore deleted asset
DELETE /api/assets/{assetId}/permanent     // Permanently delete asset
```

**Updated Behavior:**
- Existing endpoints now only work with active assets
- DELETE /{assetId} now performs soft delete
- Enhanced error handling for deleted assets

## API Usage Examples

### 1. Soft Delete an Asset
```bash
DELETE /api/assets/123
```
**Response:** 204 No Content
**Effect:** Asset marked as deleted=true

### 2. Get Deleted Assets
```bash
GET /api/assets/deleted?page=0&size=10
```
**Response:** Paginated list of soft deleted assets

### 3. Restore a Deleted Asset
```bash
POST /api/assets/123/restore
```
**Response:** 200 OK
**Effect:** Asset marked as deleted=false

### 4. Permanently Delete an Asset
```bash
DELETE /api/assets/123/permanent
```
**Response:** 204 No Content
**Effect:** Asset permanently removed from database

### 5. Get All Assets (Including Deleted) - Admin Only
```bash
GET /api/assets/all-including-deleted?page=0&size=10
```
**Response:** All assets regardless of deletion status

## Business Rules

### Asset Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Asset created with deleted=false
2. **Active Use**: Normal CRUD operations available
3. **Soft Delete**: Asset marked as deleted=true, hidden from regular queries
4. **Restoration**: Asset can be restored (deleted=false)
5. **Permanent Delete**: Asset permanently removed (cannot be undone)

### Operation Restrictions
- **Cannot Update**: Deleted assets cannot be updated
- **Cannot Assign**: Deleted assets cannot be assigned to users
- **Cannot Query**: Deleted assets not returned in regular searches
- **Duplicate Checks**: Only active assets checked for duplicates

## Audit Trail

### New Audit Actions
- `SOFT_DELETE`: Asset soft deleted
- `RESTORE`: Asset restored from soft delete
- `PERMANENT_DELETE`: Asset permanently deleted

### Audit Integration
- All soft delete operations logged
- Restoration events tracked
- Permanent deletion logged before removal

## Error Handling

### Exception Types
- `IllegalStateException`: When trying to update/delete already deleted assets
- `ResourceNotFoundException`: When trying to access deleted assets via regular endpoints

### Error Messages
```java
"Cannot update deleted asset with ID: {assetId}"
"Asset is already deleted: {assetId}"
"Asset is not deleted: {assetId}" // For restore operations
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_asset_deleted ON asset(deleted);
```

### Query Performance
- All queries include deleted filter
- Index on deleted field ensures efficient filtering
- Compound indexes may be needed for complex queries

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Regular users: Can only see active assets
- Admin users: Can see all assets including deleted
- Super admin: Can permanently delete assets

### Data Retention
- Soft deleted assets retain all relationships
- Audit trail preserved for deleted assets
- Compliance with data retention policies

## Migration Strategy

### For Existing Data
1. **Safe Migration**: All existing assets marked as active (deleted=false)
2. **Index Creation**: Performance index created for deleted field
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing API behavior maintained for active assets

### Rollback Plan
1. **Data Preservation**: Deleted field can be removed while preserving all other data
2. **Query Updates**: Can revert to previous query patterns
3. **API Compatibility**: Previous endpoints continue to work

## Testing Requirements

### Test Scenarios
```java
@Test
void testSoftDeleteAsset() {
    // Test asset soft deletion
}

@Test
void testCannotUpdateDeletedAsset() {
    // Test prevention of deleted asset updates
}

@Test
void testRestoreDeletedAsset() {
    // Test asset restoration
}

@Test
void testDeletedAssetsNotInRegularQueries() {
    // Test deleted assets hidden from regular queries
}

@Test
void testPermanentDelete() {
    // Test permanent asset deletion
}
```

### Performance Tests
- Query performance with soft delete filters
- Index effectiveness validation
- Large dataset handling

## Benefits of Soft Delete Implementation

1. **Data Preservation**: No accidental data loss
2. **Referential Integrity**: Maintains database relationships
3. **Audit Compliance**: Complete audit trail maintained
4. **Recovery Options**: Deleted assets can be restored
5. **Reporting**: Historical data available for reporting
6. **Compliance**: Meets data retention requirements

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Operations**: Bulk soft delete/restore operations
2. **Scheduled Cleanup**: Automated permanent deletion of old soft deletes
3. **Advanced Filtering**: UI filters for deleted/active assets
4. **Restoration Workflow**: Approval process for asset restoration
5. **Data Archiving**: Move old deleted assets to archive tables

## Conclusion

The soft delete implementation provides a robust solution for asset lifecycle management while maintaining data integrity and providing recovery options. The implementation follows best practices and ensures minimal impact on existing functionality.
