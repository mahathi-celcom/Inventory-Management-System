# Asset PO Management Template Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Template Syntax Errors
**Problem**: The Angular template had malformed HTML structure causing compilation errors.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed template string formatting and indentation
- Corrected HTML element nesting and closing tags
- Ensured proper Angular template syntax

### 2. Method Visibility Issues
**Problem**: `loadData()` method was private but being called from the template.

**Solution**: The method was already public in the current codebase, so no changes were needed.

### 3. Property Reference Errors
**Problem**: Template was trying to use `po.poDate` which doesn't exist in the `AssetPoWithDetails` interface.

**Solution**: The template was already correctly using `po.acquisitionDate` as per the interface definition.

### 4. Unused Import Warnings
**Problem**: Components were imported but not used in the template:
- `FormDrawerComponent`
- `AddModalComponent` 
- `ActionButtonsComponent`

**Solution**: Removed unused imports from the component's imports array.

### 5. Missing Type Definitions
**Problem**: `FormDrawerConfig` type was referenced but not imported.

**Solution**: The property was not actually present in the current codebase, so no action was needed.

## Template Structure Enhancements

### Layout Restructuring
✅ **Header Actions**: Refresh button and "Create New Asset Purchase Order" button positioned in top-right corner
