# Vendor Update and Delete Operations - Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Update Operation Issues**

#### Problems Found:
- Missing comprehensive logging for debugging update operations
- Insufficient error handling for data integrity violations
- No validation of input data (trimming whitespace, null checks)
- Status field mapping issues in VendorMapper

#### Fixes Implemented:
- ✅ Added detailed logging throughout the update flow:
  - Input DTO logging with all field values
  - Existing entity state logging before update
  - Updated entity state logging after field updates
  - Final save result logging
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with try-catch blocks:
  - `DataIntegrityViolationException` handling with descriptive messages
  - Generic exception handling for unexpected errors
- ✅ Improved field validation and data sanitization:
  - Trimming whitespace from string fields
  - Null checks for all fields
  - Default status handling when null is provided
- ✅ Fixed VendorMapper to properly handle status field mapping

### 2. **Delete Operation Issues**

#### Problems Found:
- Inadequate foreign key constraint handling
- Missing existence verification before deletion
- Poor error messaging for constraint violations
- No logging for delete operations

#### Fixes Implemented:
- ✅ Enhanced delete method with proper existence check:
  - Fetch entity first to verify existence
  - Provide detailed error messages when vendor not found
- ✅ Comprehensive foreign key constraint handling:
  - Catch `DataIntegrityViolationException` specifically
  - Provide user-friendly error messages suggesting alternatives (deactivation)
  - Log constraint violation details for debugging
- ✅ Added detailed logging throughout delete flow:
  - Log delete attempt with vendor ID
  - Log found vendor details before deletion
  - Log successful deletion or error details

### 3. **General Improvements**

#### Transaction Management:
- ✅ Verified `@Transactional` annotations on update and delete methods
- ✅ Added `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` for read operations

#### Logging Infrastructure:
- ✅ Added `@Slf4j` annotation to VendorServiceImpl
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive logging at INFO, DEBUG, and ERROR levels
- ✅ Added structured logging with meaningful context

#### Exception Handling:
- ✅ Enhanced ResourceNotFoundException usage with detailed messages
- ✅ Added specific handling for DataIntegrityViolationException
- ✅ Implemented proper exception chaining to preserve stack traces

#### Data Validation:
- ✅ Added input sanitization (trimming whitespace)
- ✅ Implemented null-safe field updates
- ✅ Enhanced status field handling with defaults

### 4. **VendorMapper Fixes**

#### Issues Fixed:
- ✅ Added status field mapping in `toDTO()` method
- ✅ Enhanced `toEntity()` method with default status handling
- ✅ Added new `updateEntityFromDTO()` method for safe field updates

### 5. **Comprehensive Testing**

#### Unit Tests Created:
- ✅ `VendorServiceTests.java` - Basic unit tests with mocking
- ✅ Tests for successful update and delete operations
- ✅ Tests for error scenarios (vendor not found, constraint violations)
- ✅ Tests for data validation and whitespace handling

#### Integration Tests Created:
- ✅ `VendorIntegrationTest.java` - Full database integration tests
- ✅ End-to-end testing of create, update, delete operations
- ✅ Real database constraint testing
- ✅ Status activation/deactivation testing

#### Test Runner:
- ✅ `VendorTestRunner.java` - Simple test to verify all operations work together

3. **Test Files Created:**
   - `src/test/java/com/inventory/system/VendorServiceTests.java`
   - `src/test/java/com/inventory/system/integration/VendorIntegrationTest.java`
   - `src/test/java/com/inventory/system/VendorTestRunner.java`
   - `src/test/resources/application-test.properties`

## Key Improvements

### Logging Examples:
```java
log.info("Updating vendor with ID: {} - Input DTO: name={}, contactInfo={}, status={}", 
         id, vendorDTO.getName(), vendorDTO.getContactInfo(), vendorDTO.getStatus());

log.debug("Found existing vendor: id={}, name={}, contactInfo={}, status={}", 
         existingVendor.getId(), existingVendor.getName(), 
         existingVendor.getContactInfo(), existingVendor.getStatus());
```

### Error Handling Examples:
```java
} catch (DataIntegrityViolationException e) {
    log.error("Cannot delete vendor with ID: {} due to foreign key constraints. " +
             "This vendor is referenced by other entities (assets, POs, etc.)", id, e);
    throw new RuntimeException("Cannot delete vendor as it is referenced by other entities. " +
                             "Please remove all references first or deactivate the vendor instead.", e);
}
```

### Data Validation Examples:
```java
if (dto.getName() != null) {
    vendor.setName(dto.getName().trim());
}

if (dto.getStatus() != null && !dto.getStatus().trim().isEmpty()) {
    vendor.setStatus(dto.getStatus().trim());
} else if (vendor.getStatus() == null) {
    vendor.setStatus("Active");
}
```

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Test Scenarios:
- ✅ Successful update operations
- ✅ Update with vendor not found
- ✅ Update with data integrity violations
- ✅ Update with whitespace handling
- ✅ Successful delete operations
- ✅ Delete with vendor not found
- ✅ Delete with foreign key constraints
- ✅ Activate/deactivate operations

### Integration Test Scenarios:
- ✅ Full CRUD operations with real database
- ✅ Constraint violation testing
- ✅ Status management testing
- ✅ Data persistence verification

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration**: The status column already exists (V10 migration)
2. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes are backward compatible
3. **Logging**: New logging will help diagnose issues in production
4. **Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages for better UX

## Monitoring and Debugging

With the new logging in place, you can now:
- Track all vendor update/delete operations
- Identify data integrity issues quickly
- Monitor field-level changes
- Debug constraint violations effectively

The enhanced error handling provides clear guidance to users when operations fail, especially for foreign key constraint violations where deactivation is suggested as an alternative to deletion.
